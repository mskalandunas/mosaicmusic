When it comes to music, my goal is to make each piece feel organic, and I contribute to this goal by venturing out into nature for each new project and recording a myriad of sounds that may or may not have some musical merit. Besides using these sounds in music, as they are or effected to get <em class="logo">the&nbsp;most</em> out of them, I create custom instruments and VSTs to give these projects more of a distinct musical identity.</p><p class="content">Beyond the sounds themselves, I use effects, synthesis, and composition techniques that add to this idea of organic music. Whether it be a flutter of strings to create a vibrant sense of borealism or a cloud filter to vault a piece into the etherâ€“ I find these artifices to be paramount in creating an atmosphere that grows out of characters and environments rather than just accompanies them.</p><p class="content"><span class="logo">Now, go listen.</span></p><div class="vertical--divide short divide-red"></div></div></div></div></section>
